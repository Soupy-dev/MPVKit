`MPVKit` is a collection of tools to use `mpv` in `iOS`, `macOS`, `tvOS` applications.

It includes scripts to build `mpv` native libraries.

Forked from [kingslay/FFmpegKit](https://github.com/kingslay/FFmpegKit)

## Windows

`Windows/MPVKit.Windows` is the Windows x64 .NET 10 library. It uses a native
child HWND, mpv `gpu-next`/libplacebo with Direct3D 11, D3D11VA decoding, and
WASAPI audio. The Apple Swift package and renderers remain separate.

The API includes local and HTTP(S) media, request headers, HLS/DASH through
FFmpeg, exact seeks, rate/volume/mute, audio/video/subtitle selection, chapters,
audio devices and filters, video filters, subtitle styling, and external
subtitles with bounded prefetch and per-source headers. Metadata, track lists,
position, buffering, errors, and generation-specific end state are available
through immutable snapshots. Callbacks are coalesced onto the supplied
`SynchronizationContext`, or the thread pool when no context is supplied.

Hardware decoding is required by default. Unsupported video fails explicitly,
including when mpv disables its video track after decoder initialization fails.
`Preferred` and `Software` are explicit opt-ins; inspect the actual decoder in
diagnostics. Rendering, decoding, output color, and audio format are reported
separately. Scaling profiles select mpv's fast, balanced, or high-quality GPU
configuration. HDR can follow the active output, tone-map to SDR, or require
an active HDR display. The latter verifies the hosting monitor through DXGI
Output6 as well as mpv's output target. Moving a host to another monitor should
call `RefreshDisplayAsync()` after the move.

`MpvVideoHost` creates the child HWND and can move that same surface into a
resizable, topmost compact-overlay window. The media is never opened a second
time for this transition. The host application owns its UI message loop,
fullscreen policy, controls, remote commands, suspend/resume notifications,
and window lifetime. `RecoverVideoAfterResumeAsync()` reconstructs the video
decoder in the existing session and awaits a new native output frame; it does
not reopen the URL. Native child-window airspace applies, so XAML controls must
be arranged outside that HWND or placed in a separate host-owned overlay.

### Build and run on Windows

Install .NET 10 and an isolated, updated [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
distribution with a root that contains no spaces. Run from a PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
./Windows/Build.ps1 -MsysRoot C:/Tools/msys64 -InstallDependencies
./dist/windows-demo/MPVKit.Demo.exe
```

`-SelfContained` publishes the demo with its .NET runtime. For a managed-only
rebuild after the native runtime exists, use `-SkipNative`. `-Dotnet` accepts a
private SDK executable without changing the system installation.

The build clones upstream mpv 0.41.0 and FFmpeg 8.1.2 at the commits in
`Windows/native-lock.json`, builds both, verifies the selected FFmpeg dependency,
and stages the native dependency closure. FFmpeg enables D3D11VA explicitly;
no third-party mpv fork or downloaded libmpv binary is used. FFmpeg uses Windows
Schannel for verified HTTPS and libxml2 for DASH manifests. Supporting libraries
come from signed MSYS2 packages. Their exact versions and every shipped DLL's
SHA-256 are recorded in `dist/windows-x64/runtime-manifest.json`. The native
runtime is an LGPL build; preserve its accompanying dependency notices. Source
and toolchain caches live in `.local`, and output lives in `dist`; keep both
untracked. The Windows build workflow publishes build artifacts, and does not
claim GPU playback validation on a hosted runner.

The generated NuGet package contains the managed wrapper and transitive MSBuild
targets. Supply `MpvKitRuntimeDirectory` pointing to the complete native runtime
directory when building a consuming application. The targets copy its DLLs,
manifest, and notices into `runtimes/win-x64/native` for build and publish. The
player loads only from its explicit runtime directory; it does not search PATH
for an arbitrary libmpv installation.

```csharp
var host = new MpvVideoHost(parentHwnd, widthInPixels, heightInPixels);
await host.Player.Ready;
host.Player.SnapshotChanged += (_, snapshot) => UpdateControls(snapshot);
await host.Player.LoadAsync(new MpvMedia { Source = mediaUrl });
await host.Player.PauseAsync();
await host.Player.SeekAsync(120);
host.ShowCompactOverlay();
host.RestoreInline();
await host.Player.DisposeAsync();
host.Dispose();
```

Create, resize, reparent, restore, and destroy the host on its creating UI
thread. Await player disposal before destroying either its HWND or its parent.
`LoadAsync()` replaces the previous generation and waits for playback readiness;
new loads supersede earlier loads, subtitle attachments, and decoder transitions.
Loads have a configurable deadline; cancellation stops only the matching load.
The event loop sleeps until signaled and uses no idle polling. Command queues,
demuxer caches, subtitle downloads, decoded responses, and per-load external
tracks have explicit bounds. Header values are not logged by default.

Windows support is currently x64. Actual HDR display presentation, encoded
audio passthrough, surround layouts, physical suspend/resume, other GPU/driver
combinations, and long-run power behavior require their respective hardware
checks. WASAPI shared/exclusive PCM and optional encoded passthrough do not
establish Apple spatial-audio or Dolby Vision output parity. The compact
overlay is a Windows window; it does not reproduce AVKit's system PiP API.

## About Metal support

Metal support only a patch version ([#7857](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/pull/7857)) and does not officially support it yet. Encountering any issues is not strange. 

## Apple GPU and sample-buffer renderers

The `MPVKitSampleBuffer` and `MPVKitSampleBuffer-GPL` products expose two
`@MainActor` renderers. They are also included in the corresponding `MPVKit`
products. Renderer callbacks are delivered on the main actor.

| Renderer | Intended use |
|---|---|
| `MPVGPUPlayerRenderer` | Preferred inline renderer. It uses mpv `gpu-next`, Vulkan, libplacebo, MoltenVK, and a `CAMetalLayer`; its default PiP policy first attempts the same mpv session's native GPU output. |
| `MPVMetalSampleBufferRenderer` | Standalone sample-buffer renderer and hardened compatibility bridge. It renders into bounded IOSurface-backed buffers and feeds an `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`. |

Inline playback is available on iOS/tvOS 14 or newer and Apple Silicon macOS
11 or newer. Custom sample-buffer PiP is runtime-gated to iOS/tvOS 15 and
macOS 12. The new macOS renderer is arm64-only; Intel uses the unsupported stub.
MPVKit owns frame production, clocks, readiness, and safe teardown. The host
continues to own `AVPictureInPictureController`, scene and window policy,
remote-command policy, and application lifecycle decisions.

### Single-session GPU PiP

`MPVGPUPlayerRendererOptions.pictureInPictureBackendPreference` accepts:

| Preference | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `.automatic` | Default. Attempts the native one-session GPU sink once for each load, then latches the video-only compatibility bridge if the runtime probe or first-frame preparation fails. An active native failure receives at most one compatibility failover attempt. |
| `.singleSessionGPU` | Strict one-session mode. Preparation fails instead of reopening the media when the native sink is unavailable. |
| `.compatibilityDualSession` | Always uses the second, video-only mpv instance. The primary instance remains authoritative for audio, position, pause, speed, and commands. |

The native sink receives the final `gpu-next`/libplacebo image after subtitles
and OSD composition. It can render while a background `CAMetalLayer` has no
drawable, and it returns the exact frame PTS only after GPU completion. This
fork's native patch prefers direct Vulkan/libplacebo rendering into a
three-buffer IOSurface pool. When direct import is unavailable, it renders to
an exportable offscreen texture and completes an asynchronous Metal blit into
the IOSurface before releasing the exact PTS and generation. If neither runtime
probe succeeds, `.automatic` latches the compatibility bridge for that load.

The compatibility instance is muted and video-only, but it must open the URL a
second time. Use `.singleSessionGPU` when a signed, one-shot, or live source
must never be reopened. The bridge disables primary video only after its first
valid frame and waits for the restored primary output before destroying the
second instance. Backend selection never oscillates within one media load.

Use `inlineLayer` for the on-screen player and
`pictureInPictureDisplayLayer` for AVKit's sample-buffer content source:

```swift
@MainActor
func configurePlayback(url: URL) async throws {
    let renderer = MPVGPUPlayerRenderer(
        options: .init(pictureInPictureBackendPreference: .automatic)
    )
    try renderer.start()
    renderer.load(url)

    // Await this before asking AVKit to start PiP. It completes only after a
    // valid frame from the current load generation has been enqueued.
    try await renderer.preparePictureInPicture()

    // The host now asks its AVPictureInPictureController to start. Forward
    // AVKit's didStart callback only after AVKit has completed the handoff.
    renderer.beginPictureInPicture()

    // Forward AVKit's didTransitionToRenderSize value when it changes.
    renderer.updatePictureInPictureRenderSize(CGSize(width: 1280, height: 720))

    // Forward AVKit's didStop callback and its restoration decision.
    renderer.endPictureInPicture(restoringInlinePlayback: true)

    // stop() is nonblocking and idempotent. Await the drain before reuse.
    renderer.stop()
    await renderer.waitUntilStopped()
}
```

`MPVPictureInPictureState` reports `.idle`, generation-scoped `.preparing`,
`.ready`, `.active`, `.restoring`, and `.failed` states. Hosts should use
`onPictureInPictureStateChange` instead of watchdog/priming bursts. After a
PiP pause, speed change, duration change, or seek, invalidate the host-owned
AVKit playback state; `waitForPictureInPictureTimelineUpdate()` can be used to
wait until the renderer/timebase update is installed before completing a skip
command. A new load supersedes old preparation, frame, flush, and GPU callbacks.

`prepareForPictureInPictureStart(primeFrameCount:)`,
`primePictureInPictureFrames(reason:count:)`, and the standalone renderer's
`primeFrames(reason:count:)` remain for source compatibility but are deprecated.
Their counts are bounded to a coalesced immediate attempt plus one retry. New
code should await `preparePictureInPicture()`.

`MPVGPUPlayerRendererOptions` also controls the three-buffer capacity, the
one-second default preparation timeout, PiP frame size/FPS, inline drawable
pixel cap, and resize debounce interval. `updateInlineLayerLayout` updates the
visible layer immediately while coalescing expensive drawable resizes. Invalid
or non-finite sizes are ignored, and a zero-sized detachment keeps the last
valid drawable.

Hosts that require hardware-only decoding should pass
`additionalMPVOptions["hwdec-software-fallback"] = "no"`. MPVKit applies that
policy to both the primary gpu-next handle and the compatibility dual-session
PiP handle; the standalone compatibility renderer otherwise keeps its
source-compatible software-fallback default.

Diagnostics expose the requested and selected PiP backend, fallback reason,
active mpv instance count, preparation generation/latency, resize requests and
coalescing, scheduler coalescing, display backpressure, pool exhaustion, stale
generation drops, in-flight GPU buffers, GPU latency, timeline epoch/rate, and
AudioUnit recovery count. Stream codec, size, FPS, HDR tags, pixel format, and
hardware-decoder details are included as well. The actual backend is reported
as `.singleSessionGPUDirectIOSurface`,
`.singleSessionGPUAsynchronousMetalBlit`, or `.compatibilityDualSession`.

### HDR behavior and the compatibility renderer

Inline `gpu-next` playback retains its native color pipeline. EDR layer hinting
is opt-in through `enablesTargetColorspaceHint` and is enabled only when the
loaded stream is actually tagged as HDR. Single-session GPU PiP intentionally
targets predictable SDR BT.709/sRGB BGRA8, so libplacebo tone-maps HDR before
the frame reaches AVKit.

When used directly, `MPVMetalSampleBufferRenderer` keeps its standalone HDR
path: libmpv renders a high-bit-depth source, Metal converts it asynchronously
into an RGBA16F IOSurface-backed pixel buffer, and CoreVideo color metadata is
attached. Conversion failures preserve the last good frame and fall back to
tagged SDR. Its diagnostics report the active presentation backend
(`metalHighBitDepthHDRIOSurface`, `metalHDRIOSurface`, `metalIOSurface`, or
`softwareIOSurface`), formats, color tags, frame counts, failures, timeline,
backpressure, and pool usage.

Both renderers use demand-driven scheduling, bounded allocation, asynchronous
GPU completion, and asynchronous teardown. `start()` rejects reuse while the
renderer is `.stopping`; call `waitUntilStopped()` before restarting it.

The iOS, tvOS, and macOS demos exercise the renderer API. Simulator builds are
useful for compile and state-flow validation, but PiP black-frame, timing, HDR,
thermal, and long-run acceptance require physical devices.

After building Apple-platform artifacts, an Apple Silicon Mac can exercise the
native sink itself against the local Libmpv rather than only checking exported
symbols. The harness creates one real mpv handle, plays a deterministic local
H.264 fixture through gpu-next/MoltenVK, validates all four output modes and
generation-scoped IOSurface callbacks, then verifies `disable_and_drain` has no
late callback:

```bash
MPVKIT_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS_DIR=dist/release \
  MPVKIT_NATIVE_RUNTIME_REQUIRED=1 \
  bash Scripts/check-apple-pip-runtime.sh
```

Unsupported hosts print `SKIP(platform)` unless the required flag is set;
missing or incomplete artifacts and runtime failures always fail distinctly.

## Make demo app using the local build version

On a fresh manifest evaluation, `dist/release` is selected automatically only
when it contains the complete coupled libmpv, MoltenVK, libplacebo, and FFmpeg
runtime for Eclipse's active iOS, tvOS, and macOS-harness matrix. SwiftPM's
shared manifest cache does not watch generated artifact contents, however, so
deterministic build and archive commands should explicitly set
`MPVKIT_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS_DIR`. Source-only manifest evaluations continue using
the versioned remote artifacts.

Set `MPVKIT_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS_DIR` to explicitly select a different relative or
absolute directory inside this checkout. The manifest looks both in that
directory and its `xcframework/` child for the ten required unpacked
`.xcframework` directories. ZIP-only roots are rejected. Every required
artifact must expose the complete active slice/architecture matrix; a missing,
partial, or ambiguous coupled runtime fails manifest evaluation instead of
mixing private local binaries with versioned remote binaries.

Local files use the unsuffixed names emitted by `make build enable-gpl`, such as
`Libmpv.xcframework` and `Libavcodec.xcframework`. GPL binary targets are bound
to those exact validated paths. Unrelated binary targets not in the coupled
runtime set continue using their versioned remote artifacts.

A locally backported MoltenVK imported-texture residency fix is recognized only
when both `MoltenVK.xcframework` and the provenance marker
`MoltenVK.imported-mtltexture-residency-fix` exist under the selected artifact
root. Without that marker, MPVKit keeps Metal argument buffers disabled to avoid
the MoltenVK 1.4.1 asynchronous PiP device-loss path.

```bash
export MPVKIT_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS_DIR=dist/release
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies # or build a demo/Eclipse normally
```

The directory must resolve inside this MPVKit checkout because SwiftPM local
binary target paths are package-relative. The variable affects manifest
evaluation, so it must be present in the environment that launches
`xcodebuild` or resolves the package. To verify the release URL/checksum path in
a checkout that has `dist/release`, temporarily move that runtime out of the
package directory as well as unsetting the variable.
